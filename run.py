"""Q-Hub Relay Control -- double-click entry point.

Starts a local web server with the control panel and opens it in your
default browser. Leave this window open while you use the control panel;
closing it stops the server. Safe to leave running for long periods --
every command to the relay board is a short, independent connection, so a
flaky network link just means the odd retry, not a frozen program.
